<p align="center">Are you tired of navigating through generation-old-worn-down-tea-stained cook books? Or do you simply want a better place to manage your recipe collection than the notes app? Well then the MA is the place for you. Simply snap your old Mima’s cookbook pages and enjoy it being automatically scanned and formatted for easy management and recollection! Share your recipe collection with your friends! (But not the secret mac and cheese one or Nana won’t be happy). Ask our unique totallyNotChatGPT AI to make you new recipes based on your acquired taste!
</p>
<br>

## MVP :trophy:

- User authentication
- Scan user uploaded images for text
- Allow user to categorize recipes into collections (perhaps by cultural aspects)
- Automatically format all scanned recipes to fit a "standard" form
- Allow manual user input for recipes
- Share archive with friends using upload as pdf (or some other file format)
  <br> <br>

## Stretch Goals :hourglass_flowing_sand:

- Generate a new recipe using common trends in personal taste
- A blog site extension to share different cultural cuisines
- Spin to Din! (Gives you a random meal to make [may need pantry content implementation to keep it plausible])
- Expand to IOS user base (might not be as easy as we're hoping)

## Roadblocks and Possible Solutions

- Getting the database to work may take some time and effort but this is easily solvable using cooperative learning and the proper resources.
- The OCR may not be entirely effective for handwritten recipes so we may need to work on optimizing it to the best of our ability (the new ready to use google ml kit comes pretrained so this depends on how well trained it is)
- Feeling lost or experiencing imposter syndrome is a roadblock not a u-turn. Sometimes it is unavoidable and can lead to major unwarranted self-doubt. The best solution is your team members, pm, and anyone else in the acm projects program, so don't be afraid, whatever you're going through is nothing but a temporary roadblock.
  <br>

## Competition

- <a href="https://cookbookmanager.com/features/add-import-and-create-recipes">CookBook</a> - Can scan but not optimized for handwritten recipes. Paid service leaves much to be desired.
- Paprika Recipe Manager - no scanning and only free on android
- Yummly - lets you find and favorite recipes but not store your own.

## Git Commands

| git branch "branch name"      | makes a new branch                  |
| git checkout "branch name"    | switches to speicified branch       |
| git checkout -b "branch name" | combines the previous 2 commands    |
| git add .                     | finds all changed files             |
| git commit -m "Testing123"    | commit with a message               |
| git push origin "branch"      | push to branch                      |
